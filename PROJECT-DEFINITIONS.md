- Something that should be broken down differently

## üìå Important Notes

1. **Projects are long-term containers** - They don't have end dates, they evolve
2. **Epics within projects have specific goals** - These do have timelines and deliverables
3. **Keep boundaries clear** - Don't mix company operations with product development
4. **Use consistent categorization** - This helps with reporting and resource allocation
5. **Review quarterly** - Ensure project boundaries still make sense as you grow
