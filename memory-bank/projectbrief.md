# AI-Augmented Notion PMS + Knowledge Base

## Overview
You are setting up a Notion-based Project Management System (PMS) that uses AI to manage your notes, tasks, stories, epics, and knowledge base. The system connects with MCP (Multi-Component Prompting) in Cursor and Notion AI to automate workflows like:
- Auto-classification of new notes
- Auto-creation of knowledge base entries
- Retrospective generation on project completion

This includes a central note-taking and reminder hub, unstructured input handling with AI classification, and structured visual tracking.

## Step 1: Create 5 Notion Databases
1. Inbox (Notes / Ideas / Reminders)
2. Tasks
3. Stories
4. Epics
5. Knowledge Base

Each database should have the fields and views as described in the setup instructions.

## Step 2: Create Default Views
- Daily Input Page (central scratchpad)
- Sticky Notes Queue
- Task Board (Kanban)
- Story Table
- Epics Timeline
- Knowledge Table

## Core Concepts
- Central Notes/To-Do/Reminder Page
- AI Helper for classification and suggestions
- Linking with Stories/Epics
- Sticky Notes (Unclassified)
- Kanban/List/Calendar Views
- Evolving Task Pipeline

## System Flow
- Input Capture
- Classification & Linking
- Sticky Notes Holding Area
- Progress Visualization
- AI Suggestions & Automation

## AI Prompt Integration
- Note Classification (Prompt A)
- Task Completed → KB Summary (Prompt B)
- Epic Completed → Retrospective (Prompt C)

## MCP + Cursor Setup
- Install Notion MCP Plugin
- Connect Notion API Key
- Create workflows for automation

## Optional Automation Tools
- Make.com, OpenAI API, Zapier, Notion AI

## Tips
- Use clear icons and filtered views
- Review sticky notes weekly
- Add retrospectives for every Epic
- Use consistent KB tags
- Encourage structured input after brainstorming
