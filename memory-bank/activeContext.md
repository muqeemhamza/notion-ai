# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- n8n workflow for AI-powered Inbox automation (OpenAI integration)
- OpenAI API key provided for classification
- All Notion database IDs and relations referenced in workflow
- Documentation and workflow export in progress

## Recent Changes
- Rollup properties manually added in Notion UI
- All Notion relations set up via MCP
- AI-driven note classification and incomplete note handling logic finalized
- n8n automation blueprint and OpenAI prompt designed

## Next Steps
- Export/import-ready n8n workflow JSON
- Add workflow and API usage documentation to docs/mcp/
- Continuous improvement: error handling, logging, and user notification patterns

## Manual Interventions Required
- User must add rollup properties in Notion UI (completed)
- User must review and approve AI suggestions before automation acts
- User may need to configure n8n/Make/Zapier for external triggers if desired

## [2024-07-01] Update: Story & Task Creation Process
- The process for creating stories and tasks has been updated to remove any fixed structure or quota (such as the 5-task pattern).
- Stories and tasks should now be created based on the real requirements and context of the epic or story.
- LLMs and users must analyze the story/epic to determine the appropriate number and type of stories/tasks.
- Some stories may have only a few tasks, others may have many; the same applies for stories under an epic.
- See updated guidance in `instructions/CREATE-NEW-ITEMS.md`.

## [2024-07-01] Epic & Story Template Overhaul
- Epic and story templates are now comprehensive, with detailed sections for context, background, requirements, approach, risks, stakeholders, and more.
- Placeholders are encouraged if information is not yet available, but the goal is to make these living documents that serve as the single source of truth for all work breakdown.
- See `instructions/CREATE-NEW-ITEMS.md` for the new templates.
