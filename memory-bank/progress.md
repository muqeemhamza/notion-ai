# Progress Log

## What Works
- All required directories created (memory-bank, docs/mcp, system)
- .cursor/mcp.json updated with all MCPs and correct permissions
- Notion integration token and page link provided
- Project brief, product context, and active context documented
- **MCP write/edit access to Notion page confirmed via automated test entry**
- All Notion database relations set up via MCP (relations) and Notion UI (rollups)
- Rollup properties for cross-database summaries created manually as per guidance
- AI-driven Inbox note classification, suggestion, and incomplete note handling workflow designed and documented
- Board structure and user review/approval process finalized
- All Notion databases created and structured
- Professional templates set up for each database
- All key relations between databases established via Notion MCP
- Rollup properties manually added in Notion UI
- AI-driven Inbox note classification and incomplete note handling logic finalized
- n8n automation blueprint and OpenAI prompt designed

## What's Left to Build
- Finalize and share n8n workflow blueprint (with AI prompt and output schema)
- Update docs/mcp/ with automation and workflow documentation
- End-to-end testing of the full process
- Document all changes and update memory-bank after each major step
- Export/import-ready n8n workflow JSON
- Add workflow and API usage documentation to docs/mcp/
- Continuous improvement: error handling, logging, and user notification patterns

## Current Status
- System setup, documentation, and Notion automation validated
- AI workflow and board structure implemented
- Ready for workflow automation and advanced testing
- Notion Automations (native triggers) are basic; advanced workflows require n8n/Make/Zapier or MCP

## Known Issues
- None at this stage. Awaiting results from next automation steps.

## [2024-07-01] Story & Task Creation Process Updated
- Story and task creation is now flexible and context-driven, not based on a fixed template.
- The 5-task pattern and any fixed structure for stories have been removed from the process and documentation.
- LLMs and users should analyze the requirements of each epic or story to determine the appropriate breakdown.
- See `activeContext.md` and `instructions/CREATE-NEW-ITEMS.md` for details.

## [2024-07-01] Epic & Story Template Overhaul
- Epic and story templates are now comprehensive, with detailed sections for all relevant information.
- Placeholders are encouraged if information is not yet available.
- See `CREATE-NEW-ITEMS.md` for the new templates.
