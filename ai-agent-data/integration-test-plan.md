# ðŸ§ª Notion Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the test scenarios to verify that all Notion MCP integrations are working correctly with your automation system.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Inbox Entry Creation Test
**Purpose**: Verify Claude can create entries in the Inbox database

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new entry in Inbox with all required properties
2. Verify the entry appears with correct Processing Status
3. Check that AI Confidence and AI Action Plan are populated
4. Confirm visual indicators (formulas) work correctly

**Expected Results**:
- Entry appears in Inbox database
- Processing Status = "Draft" (for low confidence) or "Pending Approval" (for high confidence)
- Confidence Visual shows appropriate emoji indicator
- Action Required formula shows correct status

### 2. Database Relations Test
**Purpose**: Verify all database relations work correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a test Project entry
2. Create an Epic linked to the Project
3. Create a Story linked to the Epic
4. Create Tasks linked to the Story
5. Create a Knowledge Base entry linked to the Task

**Expected Results**:
- All relations are properly established
- Hierarchy is maintained (Project â†’ Epic â†’ Story â†’ Task)
- Knowledge Base entry shows correct relations

### 3. Inbox to Task Conversion Test
**Purpose**: Test the conversion flow from Inbox to Task

**Test Steps**:
1. Create an Inbox entry with high confidence (>70%)
2. Set Processing Status to "Pending Approval"
3. Set Approval Actions to "Approve âœ…"
4. Trigger conversion process
5. Verify Task is created with correct properties

**Expected Results**:
- Task is created in Tasks database
- Original Inbox entry status changes to "Completed"
- Task maintains link to source Inbox entry
- All properties are correctly transferred

### 4. Knowledge Base Population Test
**Purpose**: Verify Knowledge Base entries can be created and linked

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a Knowledge Base entry from existing documentation
2. Link it to relevant Epic/Story/Task
3. Verify search and retrieval works
4. Test tagging and categorization

**Expected Results**:
- KB entry is created with all properties
- Links to related items are established
- Entry is searchable by tags and content
- "Created by AI?" property is correctly set

### 5. Approval Queue Workflow Test
**Purpose**: Test the approval queue functionality

**Test Steps**:
1. Create multiple Inbox entries with varying confidence levels
2. Verify they appear in Approval Queue view
3. Test different approval actions (Approve, Update, Discard)
4. Check that Processing Attempts increment correctly

**Expected Results**:
- High confidence items appear in Approval Queue
- Items are sorted by confidence level
- Approval actions trigger appropriate workflows
- Rejected items increment Processing Attempts

## Test Data Examples

### Example Inbox Entries for Testing

#### High Confidence Entry (>90%)
```
Title: "Create user authentication system for trading platform"
Content: "Need to implement OAuth2 authentication with support for Google and GitHub login. Should include JWT tokens, refresh token rotation, and rate limiting."
Expected Classification: Task
Expected Project: Trading & Financial Markets Platform
Expected Confidence: 95%
```

#### Medium Confidence Entry (50-70%)
```
Title: "Research healthcare compliance requirements"
Content: "Look into HIPAA, FDA regulations, and other compliance needs for our medical AI products."
Expected Classification: Story or Task
Expected Project: Healthcare AI Product Development
Expected Confidence: 65%
```

#### Low Confidence Entry (<50%)
```
Title: "Meeting notes from yesterday"
Content: "Discussed various topics including budget, timeline, and next steps. Need to follow up with team."
Expected Classification: Requires user input
Expected Confidence: 30%
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Notion MCP connection established
- [ ] Can read from all databases
- [ ] Can create entries in all databases
- [ ] Database relations work correctly
- [ ] Formula properties calculate correctly
- [ ] Views filter and sort properly
- [ ] Approval workflow triggers conversions
- [ ] Knowledge Base linking works
- [ ] AI classification produces accurate results
- [ ] Confidence scoring aligns with content clarity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **MCP Connection Fails**
   - Verify integration token is correct
   - Check database IDs match
   - Ensure MCP server is running

2. **Properties Not Appearing**
   - Confirm all properties were added to databases
   - Check property types match expectations
   - Verify formula syntax is correct

3. **Conversion Flow Fails**
   - Check Processing Status transitions
   - Verify Approval Actions are set
   - Ensure related databases have correct permissions

4. **AI Classification Inaccurate**
   - Review classification prompts
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Add more context to entries

## Next Steps

1. Run through each test scenario
2. Document any failures or issues
3. Adjust configuration as needed
4. Create automated tests for ongoing monitoring
5. Set up alerts for workflow failures
