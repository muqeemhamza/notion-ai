2. **AI Classifies** → Determines type and priority
3. **Smart Conversion** → Notes become Tasks/Stories/Knowledge
4. **Auto-Linking** → Maintains relationships
5. **Visual Tracking** → Boards and progress views
6. **Continuous Learning** → Knowledge base grows

## 📊 Database Hierarchy

```
Projects (Top Level)
    └── Epics (Major Initiatives)
         └── Stories (Features/Deliverables)
              └── Tasks (Actionable Items)

+ Inbox (Raw Capture)
+ Knowledge Base (Reusable Learnings)
```
