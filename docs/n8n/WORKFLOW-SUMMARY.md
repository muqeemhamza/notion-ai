## üîÑ How Everything Connects

### The Learning Loop
```
1. You write in Inbox ‚Üí LLM processes with your context
2. LLM suggests action ‚Üí You approve/edit
3. System learns from your choice ‚Üí Updates personal model
4. Next interaction is more accurate ‚Üí Less editing needed
5. Knowledge compounds ‚Üí System becomes extension of your thinking
```
