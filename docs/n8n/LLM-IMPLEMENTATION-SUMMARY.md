   - Writing style and vocabulary
   - Decision patterns and preferences
   - Success criteria and approaches

2. **Knowledge Base** - Active solution provider
   - Proven solutions with success rates
   - Templates that work for you
   - Novel approaches worth sharing

3. **Context Management** - Real-time intelligence
   - Current work state and focus
   - Active relationships and dependencies
   - Team dynamics and project context

### Bidirectional Benefits
- Every decision updates all three systems
- KB solutions improve based on actual usage
- Patterns discovered in one workflow enhance all others
- Novel solutions automatically become reusable knowledge

// System understands:
{
  how_you_categorize: "inbox items",
  how_you_prioritize: "tasks",
  how_you_break_down: "epics into stories",
  how_you_estimate: "task duration",
  how_you_name: "various entities"
}
```
