- Decision patterns and preferences
- Work habits and rhythms
- Domain expertise and methods

2. KNOWLEDGE BASE (Proven Solutions):
{relevant_kb_entries}
- Solutions with success rates
- Best practices for this context
- Templates that work
- Patterns to avoid

3. ACTIVE STATE (Current Context):
{current_work_state}
- Active projects and focus
- Recent decisions and actions
- Open loops and dependencies
- Team context and dynamics

=== INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS ===
1. Every decision must reference which intelligence source influenced it
2. Track which KB entries were helpful
3. Identify novel patterns for KB contribution
4. Maintain exact user style and patterns
5. Learn from every interaction

CRITICAL: Responses must be indistinguishable from the user's own work.
```

=== ANALYZE FOR UNIFIED LEARNING ===
Extract insights for all systems:

1. PATTERN UPDATE (Learning Engine):
   - What user pattern was revealed?
   - How should predictions adapt?
   - What style elements to update?

2. KB EFFECTIVENESS (Knowledge Base):
   - Which KB entries helped/failed?
   - Was this a novel solution?
   - Should existing KB be updated?

3. CONTEXT REFINEMENT (State):
   - What context was missing?
   - What relationships to strengthen?
   - What new connections found?

Create updates for all three systems.
```

## Implementation Tips

### 1. Prompt Customization
- Replace all `{placeholders}` with actual user data
- Add examples from the user's actual work
- Adjust complexity based on user's expertise
- Include domain-specific terminology

### 2. Dynamic Enhancement
```javascript
// Example of dynamic prompt enhancement
function enhancePrompt(basePrompt, userContext) {
  return basePrompt
    .replace('{user_writing_patterns}', userContext.writingStyle)
    .replace('{user_common_phrases}', userContext.commonPhrases.join(', '))
    .replace('{recent_categorizations}', formatRecentActions(userContext.recentActions))
    .replace('{active_epics_list}', formatItemList(userContext.activeEpics));
}
```

### 3. Unified Intelligence Improvement
- **Automatic Refinement**: Prompts improve based on KB success rates
- **Pattern Evolution**: User patterns automatically update prompts
- **KB Integration**: New solutions enhance all prompts
- **Cross-Workflow Learning**: Improvements in one area benefit all
- **Effectiveness Tracking**: Know which prompt elements actually help

### 4. Context Window Management
- Prioritize most relevant context
- Summarize when needed
- Use embeddings for semantic relevance
- Rotate examples to prevent staleness

---

## Unified Intelligence Performance Metrics

Track these enhanced metrics:

1. **KB Utilization Rate**: % of decisions using KB solutions
2. **KB Effectiveness**: Which entries actually help (hit rate)
3. **Novel Solution Detection**: New patterns discovered per week
4. **Pattern Match Accuracy**: How well we predict user behavior
5. **Learning Velocity**: Improvement rate over time
6. **Cross-Workflow Transfer**: Patterns learned in one area helping others
7. **Personalization Score**: Indistinguishability from user's work

---

## Advanced Personalization Techniques

### 1. Few-Shot Learning
Include 3-5 examples of the user's actual decisions:
```
Example 1:
Input: "Check competitor pricing"
User's Action: Created task under "Market Research" story
Category: To Convert
Entity: Task

Example 2:
Input: "New feature: customer dashboard"
User's Action: Created epic with 5 stories
Category: To Convert
Entity: Epic
```

### 2. Style Mirroring
```
If user writes: "impl user auth with OAuth"
AI should write: "impl OAuth integration for user auth"
NOT: "Implement user authentication system using OAuth 2.0 protocol"
```

### 3. Confidence Calibration
```
High confidence (>0.9): Direct pattern match with past decisions
Medium confidence (0.7-0.9): Similar context but new combination
Low confidence (<0.7): Novel situation, flag for review
```
