# Confidence Scoring Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how the AI calculates confidence scores (0-100%) for inbox item analysis, what factors influence the score, and how to interpret and improve confidence levels.

---

## Confidence Score Components

### 1. Base Confidence Factors (25% each)

#### 1.1 Clarity of Intent (0-100%)
How clearly the inbox item expresses what needs to be done.

**High Clarity (90-100%)**
- Explicit action verbs (create, update, fix, implement)
- Clear deliverables mentioned
- Specific outcomes described
- Examples: "Create login page with email/password fields"

**Medium Clarity (60-89%)**
- General intent clear but details missing
- Some interpretation required
- Examples: "Need authentication system"

**Low Clarity (0-59%)**
- Vague or ambiguous language
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Examples: "Look into user stuff"

#### 1.2 Information Completeness (0-100%)
How much required information is present.

**Complete Information (90-100%)**
- All context provided
- Technical requirements specified
- Dependencies mentioned
- Timeline/priority indicated

**Partial Information (60-89%)**
- Core information present
- Some details missing but can be inferred
- Context mostly clear

**Insufficient Information (0-59%)**
- Critical details missing
- No context provided
- Cannot determine scope

#### 1.3 Parent Item Certainty (0-100%)
How confidently the item can be linked to existing project/epic/story.

**Clear Parent (90-100%)**
- Explicit mention of project/epic/story name
- Direct reference to existing work
- Obvious domain match
- Example: "Add to Healthcare AI Epic"

**Probable Parent (60-89%)**
- Domain keywords match existing items
- Logical connection to ongoing work
- Reasonable assumptions possible

**Uncertain Parent (0-59%)**
- No clear connection to existing work
- Could belong to multiple areas
- New area not previously defined

#### 1.4 Classification Certainty (0-100%)
How clearly the item fits into Task/Story/Epic/Knowledge categories.

**Clear Classification (90-100%)**
- Obviously fits one category
- Meets all criteria for that type
- Scope and effort clearly indicate type

**Probable Classification (60-89%)**
- Mostly fits one category
- Minor ambiguity about scope
- Could potentially be adjacent type

**Ambiguous Classification (0-59%)**
- Could be multiple types
- Scope unclear
- Missing key classification indicators

## Confidence Calculation Formula

```javascript
function calculateConfidence(factors) {
  // Base calculation: average of all factors
  const baseConfidence = (
    factors.clarityOfIntent +
    factors.informationCompleteness +
    factors.parentItemCertainty +
    factors.classificationCertainty
  ) / 4;
  
  // Apply modifiers
  let finalConfidence = baseConfidence;
  
  // Positive modifiers
  if (factors.hasUserFeedback) {
    finalConfidence += 15; // Boost for incorporating feedback
  }
  
  if (factors.exactProjectMatch) {
    finalConfidence += 10; // Boost for exact project name match
  }
  
  if (factors.previousSuccessfulMatch) {
    finalConfidence += 5; // Boost if similar items processed before
  }
  
  // Negative modifiers
  if (factors.multipleInterpretations > 2) {
    finalConfidence -= 20; // Penalty for high ambiguity
  }
  
  if (factors.conflictingKeywords) {
    finalConfidence -= 15; // Penalty for mixed signals
  }
  
  if (factors.attemptNumber > 2) {
    finalConfidence -= 10; // Penalty for multiple failed attempts
  }
  
  // Ensure bounds
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, Math.round(finalConfidence)));
}
```

## Troubleshooting Low Confidence

### Diagnostic Questions
1. Is the intent clear from the title alone?
2. Can you identify the parent without searching?
3. Is the scope obviously Task/Story/Epic?
4. Are all requirements listed?
5. Is there conflicting information?

### Quick Fixes
- Add explicit parent reference ‚Üí +15-20%
- Clarify scope and effort ‚Üí +10-15%
- Add domain keywords ‚Üí +5-10%
- Structure with bullet points ‚Üí +5-10%
- Remove ambiguity ‚Üí +10-20%

### When to Skip AI Processing
If confidence remains below 50% after 2 attempts:
- Consider manual processing
- Break into multiple clearer items
- Create as draft for human review
- Add to knowledge base for future reference
