# n8n Automations with Unified Intelligence - Notion PMS & Knowledge Base

This folder contains enhanced workflow documentation featuring the **Unified Intelligence Layer** - a revolutionary approach that combines:
- **Context Management**: Understanding user patterns and preferences
- **Learning Engine**: Continuous improvement from every interaction
- **Knowledge Base**: Active participation in decisions with proven solutions

Every workflow now learns and improves automatically, creating compound intelligence across your entire system.

## Enhanced Workflows with Unified Intelligence

### Core Intelligence Infrastructure
- **Unified Intelligence Hub** - Central orchestrator for all three systems
- **Bidirectional Learning Loop** - Updates patterns, KB, and context simultaneously
- **Knowledge Graph Storage** - Semantic search and relationship tracking

### Intelligent Workflows
- **Intelligent Inbox Processing** - KB-powered classification with pattern learning
- **Epic Creation Cascade** - Uses successful templates from past epics
- **Dynamic Entity Updates** - Understands references using historical patterns
- **Knowledge Capture** - Automatically detects and stores novel solutions
- **Smart Prioritization** - Learns from your prioritization decisions
- **Duplicate Detection** - Semantic understanding of your "duplicate" concept

Each workflow now includes KB integration, pattern learning, and effectiveness tracking.

## ðŸ¤– Unified Intelligence Prompts

All prompts now include three layers of intelligence for maximum personalization:

### 1. Intelligent Inbox Processing
**Enhanced Prompt with Unified Context:**
```
You have access to unified intelligence:

USER PATTERNS: {{patterns}}
RELEVANT KB SOLUTIONS: {{kb_solutions}}
CURRENT CONTEXT: {{active_work}}

Classify this note using the user's exact patterns. Indicate which KB entries influenced your decision.
Note: {{content}}
```

### 2. Story Prioritization with Learning
**Enhanced Prompt:**
```
USER'S PRIORITIZATION PATTERNS: {{priority_patterns}}
SUCCESSFUL PRIORITIZATION HISTORY: {{kb_priority_examples}}

Given these stories, apply the user's exact prioritization logic. Track which pattern you're using.
Stories: {{stories_json}}
```

### 3. Task Prioritization with Intelligence
**Enhanced Prompt:**
```
TASK PRIORITIZATION INTELLIGENCE:
- User typically prioritizes by: {{user_priority_factors}}
- Successful patterns: {{kb_task_patterns}}
- Current sprint focus: {{active_context}}

Prioritize these tasks using proven patterns. Indicate confidence level.
Tasks: {{tasks_json}}
```

### 4. Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval
**Enhanced Prompt:**
```
UNIFIED KB SEARCH:
- User's knowledge application patterns: {{kb_usage_patterns}}
- Most effective KB entries for this user: {{top_kb_by_effectiveness}}
- Semantic similarity threshold: {{user_relevance_threshold}}

Find relevant knowledge considering both content match and past effectiveness.
Current work: {{story_content}}
Track which entries are suggested and why.
```

### 5. Automated Progress Updates
**Prompt:**
```
Draft a status update for this story/task: {{content}}
```

### 6. Batch Processing with Pattern Recognition
**Enhanced Prompt:**
```
BATCH INTELLIGENCE:
- User's archival patterns: {{archive_patterns}}
- Conversion triggers: {{conversion_patterns}}
- KB solutions for batch processing: {{kb_batch_solutions}}

Process these notes using learned patterns. Flag any novel situations.
Notes: {{notes_json}}
Provide confidence score for each decision.
```
