# 📚 Knowledge Base Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use and maintain the Knowledge Base for capturing reusable knowledge, lessons learned, and important decisions across all projects.

## Purpose of the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base serves as:
- **Institutional Memory**: Preserving important learnings
- **Reference Library**: Quick access to solutions and patterns
- **Decision Record**: Documenting why choices were made
- **Best Practices Hub**: Sharing what works well
- **Problem Solver**: Avoiding repeated mistakes

## Creating Knowledge Base Entries

### When to Create an Entry

Create a KB entry when:
- ✅ You solve a complex problem
- ✅ You make an important decision
- ✅ You complete significant research
- ✅ You discover a better way to do something
- ✅ You want to prevent others from repeating mistakes
- ✅ You need to document a process

### Entry Creation Process

1. **During Task Work**
   ```markdown
   ## In your task notes:
   **Knowledge Capture:** This solution should be documented
   - Problem: [What was the issue]
   - Solution: [How you solved it]
   - KB Title: "[Proposed KB entry name]"
   ```

2. **Create the Entry**
   ```javascript
   // Using Notion MCP
   const kbEntry = await notion.pages.create({
     parent: { database_id: DATABASES.knowledgeBase },
     properties: {
       "Title": {
         title: [{
           text: { content: "How to Handle Rate Limiting in External APIs" }
         }]
       },
       "Type": {
         select: { name: "Lesson Learned" }
       },
       "Tags": {
         multi_select: [
           { name: "API" },
           { name: "Performance" },
           { name: "Integration" }
         ]
       },
       "Status": {
         select: { name: "Draft" }
       },
       "Importance": {
         select: { name: "High" }
       },
       "Related Task": {
         relation: [{ id: "task-id" }]
       }
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Link Back to Source**
   ```javascript
   // Update the task to reference the KB entry
   await notion.pages.update({
     page_id: "task-id",
     properties: {
       "Knowledge Entry": {
         relation: [{ id: kbEntry.id }]
       }
     }
   });
   ```

## Writing Effective KB Entries

### 1. Clear Problem Statement
```markdown
## 📝 Summary
When integrating with Slack's API, we encountered rate limiting that caused message delivery failures during high-volume periods.

## 📖 Full Description

### The Problem
Our notification system was sending 100+ messages per minute during peak hours, triggering Slack's rate limits (1 message per second per channel). This resulted in:
- 40% of notifications failing
- No retry mechanism
- Poor user experience
```

### 2. Actionable Solution
```markdown
### The Solution
Implemented a queue-based approach with exponential backoff:

1. **Message Queue**: Redis-based queue for all Slack messages
2. **Rate Limiter**: Token bucket algorithm (1 token/second)
3. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with max 5 retries
4. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for queue depth

### Implementation Code
```python
class SlackRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bucket = TokenBucket(rate=1, capacity=10)
        self.queue = RedisQueue('slack-messages')
    
    async def send_message(self, channel, message):
        await self.queue.push({
            'channel': channel,
            'message': message,
            'attempts': 0
        })
```
```

### 3. Lessons and Recommendations
```markdown
### Key Learnings
1. **Always implement rate limiting** for external APIs
2. **Queue everything** - don't send directly
3. **Monitor queue depth** - early warning system
4. **Document rate limits** in code comments

### Recommendations
- Use this pattern for all external API integrations
- Consider implementing at the API gateway level
- Budget for queue infrastructure (Redis/SQS)
```

## Searching and Using KB

### 1. Before Starting Work
```javascript
// Search KB for relevant entries
const relevantKB = await notion.databases.query({
  database_id: DATABASES.knowledgeBase,
  filter: {
    or: [
      {
        property: "Tags",
        multi_select: { contains: "authentication" }
      },
      {
        property: "Title",
        title: { contains: "auth" }
      }
    ]
  }
});

// Review and link to your task
```

### 2. Tag Effectively
Use consistent tags for discoverability:
- **Technical**: API, Database, Security, Performance
- **Domain**: Healthcare, Trading, Marketing
- **Type**: Integration, Architecture, Process
- **Technology**: Python, React, PostgreSQL, AWS

### 3. Cross-Reference
Always link KB entries to:
- Source tasks/stories/epics
- Related KB entries
- External documentation

---

## Maintaining KB Quality

### 1. Review Cycle
```markdown
## Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review all "Draft" entries
- **Quarterly**: Update high-importance entries
- **Annually**: Archive obsolete entries

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Information still accurate?
- [ ] Code examples still work?
- [ ] Better solutions available?
- [ ] Links still valid?
- [ ] Tags appropriate?
```

### 2. Validation Process
```javascript
// Automated validation
async function validateKBEntry(entryId) {
  const entry = await notion.pages.retrieve({ page_id: entryId });
  
  const issues = [];
  
  // Check for required fields
  if (!entry.properties.Type?.select) {
    issues.push("Missing Type");
  }
  
  if (!entry.properties.Tags?.multi_select?.length) {
    issues.push("No tags assigned");
  }
  
  // Check age
  const lastUpdated = new Date(entry.last_edited_time);
  const monthsOld = (Date.now() - lastUpdated) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30);
  if (monthsOld > 6) {
    issues.push("Not updated in 6+ months");
  }
  
  return issues;
}
```

### 3. Quality Standards
Every KB entry should have:
- ✅ Clear, searchable title
- ✅ Accurate type classification
- ✅ At least 3 relevant tags
- ✅ Complete problem/solution description
- ✅ Links to source material
- ✅ Code examples (if technical)
- ✅ Last updated date

---

## KB Entry Lifecycle

### 1. Creation → Draft
New entries start as drafts for review.

### 2. Draft → Review
Team reviews for accuracy and completeness.

### 3. Review → Published
Approved entries become searchable references.

### 4. Published → Updated
Regular updates keep entries relevant.

### 5. Updated → Archived
Obsolete entries are archived, not deleted.

---

## Integration with n8n

### 1. Automatic KB Creation
```yaml
Trigger: Task marked "Done" with "Create KB" tag
Actions:
  1. Create KB entry from task notes
  2. Link KB to task
  3. Notify team of new KB entry
  4. Add to review queue
```

### 2. KB Search Assistant
```javascript
// n8n workflow for KB recommendations
async function suggestRelevantKB(taskDescription) {
  // Extract keywords
  const keywords = extractKeywords(taskDescription);
  
  // Search KB
  const suggestions = await searchKnowledgeBase(keywords);
  
  // Add as comment to task
  if (suggestions.length > 0) {
    await addComment(taskId, 
      `📚 Relevant KB entries found:\n${formatSuggestions(suggestions)}`
    );
  }
}
```

### 3. Quality Monitoring
```javascript
// Weekly KB quality report
async function generateKBReport() {
  const stats = {
    total: await countKBEntries(),
    byType: await countByType(),
    needsReview: await findOldEntries(),
    drafts: await countDrafts(),
    orphaned: await findOrphanedEntries()
  };
  
  return formatReport(stats);
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Create KB entries as you work
- Link everything (tasks ↔ KB)
- Use consistent tags
- Include code examples
- Update regularly
- Think "will this help someone else?"

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't wait until project end
- Don't create without linking
- Don't use vague titles
- Don't forget to tag
- Don't let entries go stale

### Quick Tips 💡
- **Title Formula**: [Action] + [Topic] + [Context]
  - ✅ "How to Handle Slack API Rate Limiting"
  - ❌ "Slack Issues"

- **Tag Formula**: [Technical] + [Domain] + [Specific]
  - ✅ Tags: API, Integration, Slack, Rate-Limiting
  - ❌ Tags: Issue, Problem

- **Summary Formula**: Problem + Solution + Result
  - ✅ "Slack messages failing due to rate limits. Implemented queue with rate limiter. Reduced failures from 40% to <1%."
  - ❌ "Fixed Slack"

Remember: The Knowledge Base is only valuable if it's used. Make entries discoverable, actionable, and current!
