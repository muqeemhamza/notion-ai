# 🎯 Current Action Items for AI Notion Project

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-04  
**Status**: Ready for n8n workflow implementation

## ✅ What You've Completed
- ✓ Added all required database properties to Notion Inbox
- ✓ Created database views (Approval Queue, Drafts, Processing Dashboard, Completed)
- ✓ MCP configurations verified and working
- ✓ Project structure organized (3 main projects defined)

## 🚀 Immediate Action Items (Do These First)

### 1. Import n8n Workflow (Priority: HIGH)
**File**: `/ai-agent-data/corrected-workflows/intelligent-inbox-processing-v2.json`

**Steps**:
1. Log into your n8n instance: `https://techniq.app.n8n.cloud`
2. Click "Workflows" → "Add workflow" → "Import from file"
3. Select the corrected workflow file above
4. Save the workflow but DON'T activate yet

### 2. Configure n8n Credentials (Priority: HIGH)
You need to set up these credentials in n8n:

**OpenAI API**:
1. In n8n, go to "Credentials" → "Add credential" → "OpenAI API"
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Name it "OpenAI API" (must match the workflow reference)

**Notion API** (should already exist):
1. Verify it exists with name "Notion API"
2. Token should be: `ntn_f35248778523jpOe6IQngDnseZlexMBsf2YC7jt6WEb9NF`

### 3. Test the Workflow (Priority: HIGH)
**Test Data**: `/ai-agent-data/sample-inbox-entries.json`

**Manual Test Steps**:
1. In n8n, open the imported workflow
2. Click on "Notion Trigger - New Inbox Item" node
3. Click "Listen for Test Event"
4. In Notion, manually add one of these test entries to your Inbox:

```
Title: "Implement real-time market data feed for trading dashboard"
Content: "We need to set up WebSocket connections to receive real-time price updates from Interactive Brokers API. This should include bid/ask spreads, last trade price, volume, and market depth."
```

5. The workflow should trigger and process the item
6. Check your Inbox in Notion - you should see:
   - Processing Status: "Pending Approval" (high confidence)
   - AI Confidence: ~92%
   - AI Action Plan: Populated with classification and recommendations

### 4. Monitor Approval Queue (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. Go to your Notion Inbox database
2. Switch to "📋 Approval Queue" view
3. You should see high-confidence items waiting for approval
4. For each item:
   - Review the AI Action Plan
   - If correct, set "Approval Actions" to "Approve ✅"
   - The workflow should auto-create the Task/Story/Epic

## 📋 Secondary Action Items

### 5. Set Up Supabase Tables (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Purpose**: Store processing history and user context

**Tables to Create**:
```sql
-- User context table
CREATE TABLE user_context (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  writing_style JSONB,
  preferences JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Processing history table
CREATE TABLE processing_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  inbox_item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  classification TEXT,
  confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
  entity_created TEXT,
  project TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Context requests log
CREATE TABLE context_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT,
  workflow TEXT,
  context JSONB,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 6. Configure Webhook Authentication (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. In n8n, create a new credential: "Header Auth"
2. Set header name: `X-Webhook-Token`
3. Generate a secure token (e.g., use `openssl rand -hex 32`)
4. Add to workflow webhook nodes

### 7. Run Integration Tests (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Test Plan**: `/ai-agent-data/integration-test-plan.md`

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Create inbox entry → Triggers workflow
- [ ] Low confidence (<50%) → Status = "Draft"
- [ ] Medium confidence (50-70%) → Status = "Draft" or "Pending Approval"
- [ ] High confidence (>70%) → Status = "Pending Approval"
- [ ] Very high confidence (>90%) → Auto-processes (if enabled)
- [ ] Approval action works → Creates entity
- [ ] Knowledge capture works → Creates KB entry
- [ ] Error handling works → Logs errors

### 8. Set Up Error Notifications (Priority: LOW)
Create a simple error notification workflow:
1. Create new workflow in n8n
2. Add "Error Trigger" node
3. Add "Send Email" or "Slack" node
4. Configure to notify you of failures

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these to ensure the system is working:
1. **Classification Accuracy**: >80% correct classifications
2. **Confidence Calibration**: High confidence = high accuracy
3. **Processing Time**: <30 seconds per item
4. **Approval Rate**: >70% of pending items get approved
5. **Error Rate**: <5% workflow failures

## 🔄 Daily Workflow (Once Set Up)

1. **Morning**: 
   - Add new notes/ideas to Inbox
   - Don't worry about formatting

2. **AI Processing** (Automatic):
   - Items get classified
   - High-confidence items go to Approval Queue

3. **Review Time** (10-15 mins):
   - Check Approval Queue
   - Approve/reject/modify items
   - Review any low-confidence drafts

4. **End of Day**:
   - Check Completed view
   - Verify tasks/stories created correctly

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Workflow doesn't trigger**:
- Check Notion integration token is correct
- Verify workflow is activated in n8n
- Check n8n execution logs

**AI classifications are wrong**:
- The AI improves over time
- For now, manually correct via Approval Queue
- Consider adjusting confidence thresholds

**Items stuck in "Processing"**:
- Check n8n execution history for errors
- Manually update status to "Draft" to retry

## 📞 Next Support Session

Once you've completed items 1-4, we can:
1. Fine-tune the AI prompts based on your usage patterns
2. Set up more advanced workflows (Epic cascade, Knowledge capture)
3. Implement the context management system
4. Add more sophisticated approval logic

**Remember**: Start small! Get the basic inbox processing working first before adding complexity.
